  # main.chromium.perf.fyi uses bulidbucket in an interesting way:
  #
  # main.chromium.perf has builders and testers, but main.chromium.perf.fyi
  # has only testers. The former builds chromium and triggers testers on the FYI
  #
  # Some builders on main.chromium.perf run for each commit, and thus trigger
  # builds on FYI for each commit. FYI does not have capacity to run a build
  # for each commit, so it uses buildbot "merge requests" feature that collapses
  # multiple build requests into a single build.
  #
  # The chromium.perf -> chromium.perf.fyi build triggering is implemented
  # using buildbucket. Each buildbucket build is converted to one buildbot
  # build request. When a subordinate becomes available, all build requests are
  # merged into one build which is associated with combined changes of all
  # build requests, aka blamelist. However buildbucket-buildbot integration
  # does not support build request merging (crbug.com/451259), thus when the
  # buildbot build is complete, only one buildbucket build is updated with the
  # result and the rest of buildbucket builds stay leased in the buildbot
  # process. They do not get rescheduled, but buildbot keeps extending their
  # leases. In 48 hours buildbucket server forcibly cancels them by timeout. As
  # a result, if the buildbot process was not restarted during these 48 hours,
  # a single build is executed per revision.
  #
  # Luckily, nothing consumes buildbucket build results, including the builds
  # that trigger them. Only humans care about the triggered builds and they
  # consume them by looking at the buildbot pages which don't have the issue,
  # because the build requests are correctly scheduled, and the build with a
  # correct blamelist is run. So, this is fine.

  # commit URLs, see long comment above), so buildbucket reuses "changes" table
  # rows created by gitiles poller.
