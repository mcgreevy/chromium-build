"""Helper to enable some svn-like operations on git repositories.

There are two operations in particular that are easy to do in SVN but hard to do
in Git:
  * Get the contents of a file at a particular revision
  * Get the relative ordering of a set of commits

The first is difficult because Git (as a distributed system) doesn't provide
'svn cat'-like functionality. In order to get the contents of a file, you must
have all of the repository objects cloned locally.

The second is difficult because Git (with its emphasis on branch workflows)
doesn't provide sequential monotonically increasing revision numbers. In order
to get a (weak) ordering on a set of commits, we must compute generation numbers
from the repository root and then compare those.

This file provides a lightweight way to perform both of these actions. It
provides a class that encapsulates checking out the necessary repository to a
temporary directory, gleaning the reqested information from that repo, and
cleaning up after itself.

  from git_helper import GitHelper
  repo = GitHelper('https://path.to/my/repo.git')

  # get the contents of a readme, ten revisions ago.
  file = repo.show('docs/README.md', 'main~10')

  # get the generation numbers of any number of commits
  commits = ['deadbeef', 'feedbead']
  ordering = repo.number(*commits)
  sorted_commits = [pair[1] for pair in sorted(zip(ordering, commits))]

  # clean up
  repo.destroy()

For super lightweight operations, GitHelper can be used as a context manager
that cleans up after itself.

  with GitHelper('https://path.to/my/repo.git') as g:
    g.show('VERSION')

Commit ordering is implemented via depot_tools/git-number, by iannucci@.
