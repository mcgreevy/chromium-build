    of the |factory_properties|. This setup allows for major changes to factory
    properties to occur on subordinate-side without main restarts.

    NOTE: Please be very discerning with what |factory_properties| you pass to
    this method. Ideally, you will pass none, and that will be sufficient in the
    vast majority of cases. Think very carefully before adding any
    |factory_properties| here, as changing them will require a main restart.

    |recipe| is the name of the recipe to pass to annotated_run.  If omitted,
    annotated_run will attempt to look up the recipe from builders.pyl in the
    main.

    |timeout| refers to the maximum number of seconds a build should be allowed
    to run without output. After no output for |timeout| seconds, the build is
    forcibly killed.

    |max_time| refers to the maximum number of seconds a build should be allowed
    to run, regardless of output. After |max_time| seconds, the build is
    forcibly killed.
